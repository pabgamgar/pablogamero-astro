I publish my website as a small home base on the internet. It is less a product and more a living journal: a place to share what I am building, what I am learning, and how I am thinking about the work.

This project exists to give me an outlet for projects, thoughts, and learnings as they happen, without the friction of social platforms. If you are curious about my work, this is where I keep it.

Built with Astro, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with content managed in `src/content/` and deployed to Cloudflare Pages.
