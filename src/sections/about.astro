      <p>
        I'm Pablo Gamero, a Computer Engineering student who thrives on
        connecting with others. I believe in the power of collaboration and am
        always seeking opportunities to be part of meaningful projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's exploring the latest technological advancements, pursuing
        entrepreneurial endeavors, or diving into the world of music and
        psychology, I find joy in learning and connecting with like-minded
        individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have something to share or need a helping hand, I would be
        delighted to connect with you. Let's make something great together!

      <li>
        <span class="bold">The 1% Rule.</span> To get really good at any skill or
        discipline, put yourself on a schedule and aim to get 1% better at some aspect
        of that skill with each new project. Over time, you‚Äôll see your skills grow
        rapidly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Show up and have something to show.</span> If you want
        to build great professional relationships and position yourself for more
        ‚Äúlucky‚Äù opportunities, both of these actions are needed. You must spend a
        significant amount of time creating, honing your skills, and building something
        of value you can offer others. You also have to get out there and ‚Äúshow up‚Äù
        ‚Äì attend events, interact with people online, and become a part of the community
        for whatever you‚Äôre pursuing.
