        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>
          While still studying, I'm deeply involved in various computer science
          projects and <span class="font-bold">co-founded a startup</span>. My
          journey in the tech world started with a love for learning and
          creating innovative solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally from Seville, Spain, I'm proud to call this vibrant city my
          home. When I'm not buried in code or brainstorming business ideas,
          you'll find me enjoying spontaneous mini-trips with friends, playing
          the piano, or diving into the latest tech trends.

        <h2>My Objectives</h2>
        <p>
          My goal is to create products that enhance daily life by helping
          people understand themselves better and making tasks simpler and more
          connected.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that everyone should enjoy the process of turning their
          ideas into reality, and I want to remove as many obstacles as possible
          from that journey. Inspired by David Allen's quote, "Your mind is for
          having ideas, not holding them," I am passionate about using
          technology to free our minds from mundane tasks. This way, we can
          focus our creative energy on building amazing things that add value to
          our lives.
