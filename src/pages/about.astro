                <p>I’m Pablo Gamero, and I learn by building.</p>
                <p>
                    Most of my time goes into <a
                        href="/projects/limero"
                        class="italic">Limero</a
                    >, a long-term project where I use technology to reduce
                    friction in real businesses by working closely with the
                    problems themselves, not by applying predefined solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside that, I build my own products: apps, web tools,
                    and small experiments that help me test ideas and improve my
                    judgment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website is where I keep track of that process. What I’m
                    working on, what I’m changing direction on, and what I’m
                    learning along the way. It’s not a portfolio or a pitch —
                    just an honest snapshot over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I play piano/guitar, train fitboxing, and
                    try to keep enough distance from screens to think clearly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you roam around, you’ll find notes on what I’m building,
                    projects I’ve shipped or stopped, and writing about the
                    decisions behind them.
