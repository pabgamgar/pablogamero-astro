Dibs is a minimal personal debt-tracking app that helps people record, view, and manage informal debts between friends and family. It focuses on fast entry and clear visibility of who owes what, keeping everything in one place so settling up feels less awkward. It includes per-person balances and history, reminders for settling up, and local-only storage without accounts or cloud sync.
