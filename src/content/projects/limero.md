Limero is a consulting and implementation service that acts as a fractional CTO and technology partner for businesses without in-house technical expertise. It identifies operational bottlenecks, decides the right solution, and either builds it or oversees delivery, with a focus on reducing manual work, automating processes, and integrating existing tools. The positioning is simple: tech leadership and delivery for non-technical teams that know something needs fixing but need clarity on what and how.
- Process automation and system redesign
- Websites and lightweight platforms when they remove real friction
- Technical decision-making and simplification

The form isn’t fixed. The usefulness is.

## Selected work

### REEM — internal members platform

**Context**: Research group coordination
**Problem**: Managing members, roles, and internal information across disconnected tools
**My role**: End-to-end design and development
**Outcome**: A centralized internal platform that simplified coordination and reduced manual overhead

### REEM — public website

**Context**: External communication and visibility
**Problem**: Outdated structure and content that didn’t reflect current activity
**My role**: Structure, design, and implementation
**Outcome**: A clearer, more maintainable public site aligned with how the group actually operates

## Current focus

At the moment, Limero is focused on small-scale, high-impact interventions: projects where understanding the problem well matters more than the size of the solution.
