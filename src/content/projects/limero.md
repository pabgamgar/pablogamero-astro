## What Limero is

Limero exists to reduce operational friction.

That usually means dealing with processes that are slow, manual, fragmented, or poorly supported by the tools in place. Instead of offering predefined services, I focus on understanding the specific context of a business and deciding what actually needs to be built, changed, automated, or removed.

Sometimes the result is software.
Sometimes it’s a system.
Sometimes it’s simply making fewer things exist.

## How I use Limero

I work through Limero by getting involved early and staying close to the problem.

That involves:

- Understanding how work is actually done, not how it’s described
- Identifying where time, attention, or information is being wasted
- Deciding whether technology is the right lever, and at what scale

I deliberately avoid generic solutions, heavy frameworks, and building things “just in case”. The goal is not to maximize output, but to improve how the business functions with the least added complexity.

## What comes out of it

The outcomes of work done through Limero vary, but usually fall into a few categories:

- Internal tools and small web applications
- Process automation and system redesign
- Websites and lightweight platforms when they remove real friction
- Technical decision-making and simplification

The form isn’t fixed. The usefulness is.

## Selected work

### REEM — internal members platform

**Context**: Research group coordination
**Problem**: Managing members, roles, and internal information across disconnected tools
**My role**: End-to-end design and development
**Outcome**: A centralized internal platform that simplified coordination and reduced manual overhead

### REEM — public website

**Context**: External communication and visibility
**Problem**: Outdated structure and content that didn’t reflect current activity
**My role**: Structure, design, and implementation
**Outcome**: A clearer, more maintainable public site aligned with how the group actually operates

## Current focus

At the moment, Limero is focused on small-scale, high-impact interventions: projects where understanding the problem well matters more than the size of the solution.
