Pubmefy is a web app and extension that automates the creation and updating of academic CVs. It ingests publication identifiers like DOIs or PMIDs, pulls metadata, and formats it into structured, reusable CV content aligned with official call requirements. The goal is to save researchers time and reduce manual formatting errors, with ongoing development toward automating submission workflows and form completion.

The scope is intentionally narrow. Instead of trying to cover every possible workflow, the goal is to make a specific, common process faster and less error-prone.

## What I learned

- Narrowing the problem early is more valuable than adding features later
- Domain-specific constraints matter more than technical elegance
- Automation is only useful when it mirrors how people actually work
- Small time savings compound quickly in recurring administrative tasks

## Current state

Pubmefy is currently _in development_.

The focus right now is on:

- Improving reliability of data extraction
- Tightening the core workflow
- Validating that the problem is painful enough to justify continued investment

There is no rush to expand beyond what is already useful.
