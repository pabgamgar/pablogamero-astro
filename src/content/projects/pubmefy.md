Pubmefy is a tool I’m building to reduce the friction researchers face when preparing and maintaining their academic CVs for funding calls.

The idea came from repeatedly seeing the same problem: valuable time spent copying, formatting, and updating the same information across different systems, with a high risk of small but costly errors.

## The problem

In many research environments, especially around public funding calls, researchers are required to submit CVs in very specific formats. These formats often change, are poorly integrated with existing tools, and require manual data entry even when the information already exists elsewhere.

The result is:

- Repetitive work
- Inconsistencies between documents
- Stress close to deadlines
- Time spent formatting instead of doing research

## What I built

Pubmefy focuses on turning existing publication data into structured, reusable information.

At its core, it:

- Ingests publication identifiers (such as DOIs or PMIDs)
- Extracts and normalizes the relevant metadata
- Generates CVs in the required formats
- Automates repetitive steps in official submission platforms when possible

The scope is intentionally narrow. Instead of trying to cover every possible workflow, the goal is to make a specific, common process faster and less error-prone.

## What I learned

- Narrowing the problem early is more valuable than adding features later
- Domain-specific constraints matter more than technical elegance
- Automation is only useful when it mirrors how people actually work
- Small time savings compound quickly in recurring administrative tasks

## Current state

Pubmefy is currently _in development_.

The focus right now is on:

- Improving reliability of data extraction
- Tightening the core workflow
- Validating that the problem is painful enough to justify continued investment

There is no rush to expand beyond what is already useful.
