It’sFree was an attempt to build a standalone consumer-facing business outside my usual technical and professional focus.

The idea explored a space that, at the time, seemed interesting and viable, but over time it became clear that it didn’t align with how I wanted to work or the kinds of problems I wanted to spend energy on.

## Why it didn’t continue

The project didn’t fail because of a single technical issue or execution mistake.

Instead, it became obvious that:

- The domain wasn’t one I cared deeply enough about
- The problems it addressed didn’t hold my attention long-term
- My motivation depended more on novelty than conviction

That combination made continuation unsustainable.

## What I took from it

- Interest alone is not a strong enough reason to build a business
- Long-term work requires alignment with how you want to spend your time
- Walking away early can be a productive decision, not a defeat

It’sFree served its purpose by clarifying those boundaries.
